# Spam-Mail-Prediction Using Machine learning.

**Spam Mail Detection using Logistic Regression**
-> This project is a simple spam mail detection system using a Logistic Regression model. It classifies emails as spam or ham based on the email text data.

**Project Overview**
● Model: Logistic Regression for binary classification.
● Vectorization: Text data is converted to numerical features using TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency).
● Dataset: Trained on labeled email data to classify spam emails with high accuracy.

**Key Features**
● Text Preprocessing: Cleans and prepares email text for analysis.
● Feature Engineering: Uses TF-IDF to represent text data effectively.
● Model Evaluation: Includes metrics for performance assessment.

**This project demonstrates the use of basic machine learning techniques for natural language processing and classification tasks.**
